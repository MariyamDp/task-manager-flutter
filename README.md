# DB Task Manager

DB Task Manager is a Flutter sample app demonstrating SOLID principles and proper Dependency Injection using `get_it` and `injectable`.

This repository contains developer-focused documentation and guidance to complete the assignment described in `docs/ASSIGNMENT_DOCUMENTATION.md`.

## Quick Links

- Detailed developer docs: [docs/DOCUMENTATION.md](docs/DOCUMENTATION.md)
- Assignment mapping & checklist: [docs/ASSIGNMENT_DOCUMENTATION.md](docs/ASSIGNMENT_DOCUMENTATION.md)
- Architecture diagram (PlantUML): [docs/ARCHITECTURE.puml](docs/ARCHITECTURE.puml)

## Summary — What was done

- Added comprehensive developer documentation at [docs/DOCUMENTATION.md](docs/DOCUMENTATION.md).
- Added an architecture PlantUML source at [docs/ARCHITECTURE.puml](docs/ARCHITECTURE.puml) to visualize module dependencies and DI flow.
- Added assignment-ordered documentation and implementation guidance at [docs/ASSIGNMENT_DOCUMENTATION.md](docs/ASSIGNMENT_DOCUMENTATION.md).

## How this repo aligns with the assignment

This repo includes a documentation-first deliverable that maps the assignment requirements (SOLID, DI with `get_it` + `injectable`, testing, and bonuses) to concrete file locations, implementation notes, and example snippets to help you complete the code work. See [docs/ASSIGNMENT_DOCUMENTATION.md](docs/ASSIGNMENT_DOCUMENTATION.md) for the full, ordered breakdown.

## Getting Started (quick)

Clone, fetch packages and run:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd DB_task_manager
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

If you'd like, I can also:

- Sync key sections from `docs/ASSIGNMENT_DOCUMENTATION.md` into in-repo code skeletons.
- Generate a `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Render `docs/ARCHITECTURE.puml` to a PNG and place it into `assets/`.

**Status**: All added unit tests pass locally; codegen is committed and a CI workflow checks generated files.

**Common developer tasks**:

- **Install deps**: `flutter pub get`
- **Generate DI**: `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
- **Analyze**: `flutter analyze`
- **Run tests**: `flutter test` (coverage: `flutter test --coverage`)
- **Render PlantUML**: `./scripts/render_puml.sh` (requires Docker) or run PlantUML locally

**Files of interest**:

- `lib/core/di/injection.dart` — DI entrypoint
- `lib/core/di/injection.config.dart` — generated by `injectable` (committed)
- `docs/ASSIGNMENT_DOCUMENTATION.md` — implementation mapping and checklist
- `docs/DOCUMENTATION.md` — developer quickstart and architecture notes

If you want, I can add a CI coverage job, a coverage badge in this README, or expand tests for the remaining datasources.
